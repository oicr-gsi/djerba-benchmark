This repository contains code to generate and compare [Djerba](https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba) reports on a standard set of inputs. It is intended for benchmarking and quality control.

The benchmarking code was originally part of the main Djerba repository. It diverges from the main Djerba commit history at pre-release `v1.10.1-benchmark-fork`. Subsequent releases of benchmarking code will be tagged in this repostory and numbered from `v2.0.0` onwards.
